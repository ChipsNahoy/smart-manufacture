# smart-manufacture

Digitalized manufacturing system that consisted of a material handling station, a smart warehouse, smart assembly and quality control stations, and smart storage. The material handling station creates a kanban card used for worker instruction in each station. Each station sends data to a server that saves the data in a database for monitoring.

Each python code will be ran by different computers (in my case there were 4 Pi-s).
